        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. 
            There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. 
            A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. 
            Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. 
            These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. 
            The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. 
            Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is often divided into types. The most common division is between 
            formal,non-formal, and informal education.[31] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and 
            informal education.[32] Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework. Such frameworks have 
            a chronological and hierarchical order. For instance, the modern schooling system has classes based on the 
            student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Formal education is usually 
            controlled and guided by the government. It is normally compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The history of education studies the processes, methods, and institutions 
            involved in teaching and learning. It tries to explain how they have interacted with each other and shaped
             educational practice until the present day.[228][229] Education began in prehistory, as adults trained 
             the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. For the most part, there were 
             no specialized teachers and most adults taught the youth, usually informally during everyday activities. 
             Education was achieved through oral communication and imitation. It could take the form of storytelling 
             and singing to pass knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.</p>
